PS D:\Working_Git\testing> 

git clone htts: path ==> from the git repoo path or git repository path. its downloaded the file into local drive

In command prompt change the directory 
local drive folder to git repository

>git init => created the .git folder in the local

>git commit -m "file added"
>git branch => check the branch name
>git branch -m main => modified the branch name
> git remote add orgin https://github.com/parthiban982/newrepo.git => change the orgin path
>git push orgin main => mention the orgin name and branch name 


list of branch
===================
>git branch -a => its show the list of branchs
>git branch "branch_name" ==> create a branch in the command prompt
>git pull =>changes update in the local drive
>git checkout "branch_name" ==> change to branch name
>git diff "branch_name"
